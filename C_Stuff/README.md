# C_Stuff
 -> Has Certain projects I thought to do in C, along with working around to those i.e. the progress

---

## Stuff Done:-
- [x] Pointers and memory
- [x] File Handling 
- [ ] Certain system calls and file descriptors
- [ ] projects along side. 

### Pointers and memory:- 
- [x] Pointer Arithmetic
- [x] Dynamic Allocation and 2d array
- [x] Bitwise OPS, setting bits, toggle and swap using XOR
- [x] bitmasks flag system          ----- Project
            
### File Handling:-
- [x] File Basics 
- [x] Binary Files
- [x] Structs and Arrays 
- [x] command Line Arguments 
- [x] structs and I/O in file ---DBMS
- [x] Sensor logger: store in .bin                 ---- Project
            
### System calls and File:- 
- [ ] System Calls and File descriptor basic
- [ ] A schedular (struct with PID, state, priorty|uses round robin/fcfs)
- [ ] Shell Intro
- [ ] Bitwise binary parsing
- [ ] memory allocation sim                     ---Project
- [ ] simple shell                              ---Project
            
### Some possible projects:-
- [ ] XOR file decrypter/encrypter
- [ ] ceaser cipher
- [ ] matrix multiplication 
- [ ] sotring linear regression data in a .csv
- [ ] Digital Pins' sim
- [ ] packet logger
- [ ] password analyzer
- [ ] Bitmask based control system and others
