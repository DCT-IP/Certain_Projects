# C_Stuff
 -> Has Certain projects I thought to do in C, along with working around to those i.e. the progress
 -> Aligns with course in MIT
---------------------
## Stuff Done:-
- [ ] Pointers and memory
- [ ] File Handling 
- [ ] Data Structures
- [ ] Certain system calls and file descriptors
- [ ] projects along side. 

### Poiinters and memory:- 
- [x] Pointer Arithmetic
- [ ] Dynamic Allocation and 2d array
- [ ] Bitwise OPS, setting bits, toggle and swap using XOR
- [ ] bitmasks flag system          ----- Project
            
### File Handling:-
- [ ] File Basics 
- [ ] Binary Files
- [ ] Structs and Arrays 
- [ ] command Line Arguments 
- [ ] structs and I/O in file ---DBMS
- [ ] Sensor logger: store in .bin                 ---- Project
            
### DS:-
- [ ] LLs
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees (BST->AVL->Graphs)
- [ ] Search and Sort
            
### System calls and File:- 
- [ ] System Calls and File descriptor basic
- [ ] A schedular (struct with PID, state, priorty|uses round robin/fcfs)
- [ ] Shell Intro
- [ ] Bitwise binary parsing
- [ ] memory allocation sim                     ---Project
- [ ] simple shell                              ---Project
            
### Some possible projects:-
- [ ] XOR file decrypter/encrypter
- [ ] ceaser cipher
- [ ] matrix multiplication 
- [ ] sotring linear regression data in a .csv
- [ ] Digital Pins' sim
- [ ] packet logger
- [ ] password analyzer
- [ ] Bitmask based control system and others
