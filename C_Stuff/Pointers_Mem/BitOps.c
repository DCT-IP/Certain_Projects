/*
In this I will try to do 
    1.Basic bitwise operations - and, or , xor, left shift, right shift
    2.Bit Manipulation - checking a bit to be 1, setting a bit to 1, clearing a bit(set to 0), toggle a bit, LSB(extract last), check even
    3.Masks - mask to:- 1.extract specific bits,
                        2.to turn on/off specific bits,
                        3.dynamic masks using shifts.
    4.Special Bit Tricks - swapping two numbers,
    5.2's Compliment

//The main focus is on understanding it so the project for this section can be done easily
